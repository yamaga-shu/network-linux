# traceroutes

## description
Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool that shows the path packets take to reach a destination by sending probe packets with incrementally increasing TTL (Time To Live) values. Each router along the path decrements the TTL by one; when the TTL reaches zero, the router discards the packet and replies with an ICMP “Time Exceeded” message, revealing its IP address. By collecting these messages hop by hop, traceroute maps out the entire route.

- Router: a network device that forwards packets between different networks by examining the destination IP address and consulting its routing table.  
- How it works (TTL increment): traceroute starts by sending probes with TTL=1; the first router decrements TTL to 0, drops the packet, and sends back ICMP Time Exceeded. Traceroute records that router’s IP, then sends probes with TTL=2 to reach the second hop, and so on, until it reaches the target or the maximum hop count.

Arguments:
+     host          The host to traceroute to
      packetlen     The full packet length (default is the length of an IP
                    header plus 40). Can be ignored or increased to a minimal
                    allowed value
